# Road Accident Severity Prediction

## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting the severity of road accidents using machine learning techniques. The model classifies accidents into categories such as minor, serious, or fatal based on historical accident data. The goal is to identify key factors affecting accident severity and support better road safety decisions.

## Dataset Used

The dataset contains historical road accident records with features such as:

* Weather conditions
* Road surface and road type
* Lighting conditions
* Time and location of the accident
* Vehicle and driver-related information

The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before training the machine learning models.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Make sure Python is installed on your system
3. Install required libraries using:

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
4. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open the `.ipynb` file and run the cells step by step

## Output

The notebook trains machine learning models and displays performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix to evaluate accident severity prediction.
